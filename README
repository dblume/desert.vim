# desert.vim

This is forked from https://github.com/fugalh/desert.vim

The only change I needed to make was to change the diff colors. The original
settings sometime had text match background for vimdiff'ing shell scripts.

## Instructions

Put in ~/.vim/colors or (<your-vim-dir>\vimfiles\colors on Windows) and do
`:colorscheme desert` in vim to use.

You can download it from the command line like so:

    $ curl -LSso ~/.vim/colors/desert.vim \
